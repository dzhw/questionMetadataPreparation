Description: Prepare question-metadata for https://metadata.fdz.dzhw.eu
    This package helps to create question metadata according to the domain model
    of the mdm in json format. Currently there are two formats which are
    supported:
    Zofar and Handcrafted. The Zofar format needs to be converted into the 
    Handcrafted format for further editing.
