Description: Prepare question-metadata for https://metadata.fdz.dzhw.eu
    This package helps to create question metadata according to the domain model 
    of the mdm in json format. The input for most cases will be excel files 
    which are prepared by the research project's members. If a project delivers
    json files, but they are not in a proper format, there's a tool which will 
    create excel files from the json files so that the research data center's 
    members can correct the issues.
