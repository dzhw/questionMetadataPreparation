# questionMetadataPreparation

The goal of questionMetadataPreparation is to help with preparing 
question-metadata for the 
[metadatamanagement system](https://metadata.fdz.dzhw.eu) of the research data 
center of the dzhw. If you do not work for the research data center of the dzhw,
this package will probably be only useful for learning purposes, as it's 
specifically designed to help with our internal processes.

## Installation
